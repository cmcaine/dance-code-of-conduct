# Social Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for how to act on & off the dance floor at our events.

For our hard rules on behaviour involving any kind of harrassment please see our [code of
conduct](https://github.com/michaeljones/dance-code-of-conduct/blob/master/Code.md).


## Asking & accepting requests for dances

It is completely acceptable to turn down a dance for any reason. Please be polite but do not feel
obliged to dance because someone has asked. 'No, thank you' is a suitably polite response.  If
someone does say 'no', please do not repeatedly ask them again through the session. Allow them to
ask you for a dance when they are ready.

That said, please try to dance with everyone if you can. Particularly with beginners that might be
shy or nervous.


## Unsolicited dance advice

It is inappropriate to offer advice, guidance, feedback or criticism to anyone at any time unless
they have explicitly requested it. And even then do your best to exercise kindness, consideration
and an awareness of your own limits & faults. If you have any doubts at all, consider directing them
to a teacher for feedback.  


## Personal hygiene

Dancing involves being in close proximity to other people. It is important to take care with your
personal hygiene. You should shower before the event and wear freshly washed clothes. It is also
best to have cleaned your teeth and use mints to avoid bad breath.

It is respectful to wear deodorant but not to wear heavy cologne or perfume which can be
overwhelming for your partner.
