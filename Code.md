# Dance Code of Conduct

All dancers at our event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will
enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a
safe environment for everybody.

## Need Help?

Please contact us in person, over email, via Facebook or over any other publicised channels.

## Harrassment

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression,
age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion,
sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography
or recording, unwelcome sexual attention, and sustained disruption of the event.

Whilst dancing involves physical contact between two or more people; inappropriate physical contact
is considered harrassment. This includes strong, rough, or sexual interactions that lead to an
uncomfortable dance in any respect.

## Actions

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem
appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns,
please contact a member of event staff immediately.

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement,
provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of
the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at the event, related venues and any related social
events.
