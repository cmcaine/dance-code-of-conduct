# Dance Code of Conduct

This is an attempt to create a code of conduct for dance events.

This is inspired by the programming community that has embraced written codes of conduct for their
online & in person behaviour.

I believe a code of conduct is important in establishing expected behaviour so that members of the
community have a clear idea of how to behave, what behaviour is not tolerated and where to report
bad behaviour if encountered.

It is important that members of the community feel safe & supported.

## Reference

This code of conduct is based on the [Conf Code of Conduct](https://confcodeofconduct.com).
